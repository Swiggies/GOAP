# Unity-GOAP
GOAP AI Project made for a university project. Class was Games and Graphics.

# Description
When making projects, AI has always been something I spent a lot of time on to get it right. There are a lot of assets out there to help with it but they all focus on Behaviour Trees or some other kind of HNT.

I've always been interested in GOAP and while there are a lot of GOAP packages out there, they are all too code focused. As a programmer myself this is nice but I've always wanted something that was much easier to iterate over from a design perspective.

This is where this project came from. I wanted to create a GOAP solution for Unity that was easy for designers to use and for programmers to create new behaviours.

Due to the time constraints of the class I wasn't able to flesh out the entire project.

### What works:
* Basic GOAP
* Able to add behaviours to AI agents by giving them a list of Goals and Actions.
* AI are able to carry out Actions based on their Goals
* Goals have weights to them so they will prioritise certain Goals
* Sensors can be added to Agents so that they can detect states in the world and act accordingly

### What doesn't work:
* Due to time constraints you are unable to have duplicate Actions on a single agent.
